# Bugs I found so far and needs to be fixed:
- Once hambuger menu is opened you can't close make the hambuger toggleable.
- on mobile the ui gets broken by shooting stars and gets bigger its need to delete all of the stars when its out of the user screen
- when user switchs the tab the shooting stars keeps spawning it needs to pause them
